# CoFlow Frontend Refactoring Changes

## Project Structure Refactoring

The frontend has been completely restructured following the Vue School guide for large-scale Vue.js applications. The new structure is modular and feature-based, with each module containing its own views, API services, store modules, and routes.

### Key Changes

1. **Modular Structure**:
   - Created a modular project structure with `core` and `modules` directories
   - Moved related functionality into feature modules (auth, ideas, audio)
   - Each module has its own API, store, router, and views

2. **API Service Layer**:
   - Created a centralized HTTP service with interceptors for authentication
   - Implemented dedicated API services for each module
   - Removed duplicated API URL and authentication headers

3. **Store Refactoring**:
   - Converted store modules to use TypeScript
   - Implemented namespaced modules for better organization
   - Updated store actions to use the new API services

4. **Router Refactoring**:
   - Created modular routes for each feature area
   - Combined routes in the main router
   - Improved type safety with TypeScript

5. **New Features**:
   - Added Ideas catalog with advanced filtering
   - Implemented date range filtering
   - Added sorting options
   - Created pagination for Ideas list

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/core/router/index.ts` - Main router configuration

### Auth Module

- `src/modules/auth/api/auth.service.ts` - Authentication service
- `src/modules/auth/api/index.ts` - API exports
- `src/modules/auth/store/auth.store.ts` - Auth store module
- `src/modules/auth/store/index.ts` - Store exports

- `src/modules/ideas/views/IdeaDetail.vue` - Idea detail view

### Audio Module

- `src/modules/audio/router/index.ts` - Audio routes

### Configuration

- `src/main.ts` - Updated to use new modular structure
- `package.json` - Added lodash dependency
- `jsconfig.json` - Added for path aliases

### Documentation

- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Documentation of the new project structure
- `CHANGES.md` - Summary of changes made

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Improved Organization**: Code is organized by feature, making it easier to locate and understand
2. **Better Maintainability**: Each module is self-contained and can be maintained independently
3. **Enhanced Reusability**: Services and components can be easily reused across modules
4. **Scalability**: New features can be added as modules without affecting existing code
5. **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration provides better type checking and IDE support
6. **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized approach to API calls, state management, and routing

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Audio module implementation with the new structure
2. Update tests to work with the new structure
3. Implement additional features as needed
